# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Genevieve

Iâ€™m an independent researcher, working on bringing together Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience. I'm writting about my journey on [Substack](https://genandlam.substack.com/).

I have over 5 years of experience as a [Data Scientist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/genandlam/ ), developing AI/ML pipelines with Large Language Models, Deep Learning, and applications in recommendation systems & time series forecasting. Iâ€™ve also [published research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=djah3lgAAAAJ) on multi-modal deep learning for healthcare and neurological diseases, which Iâ€™ve had a lifelong interest in.

Iâ€™m motivated to advance neuroscience research using state-of-the-art AI tools.
